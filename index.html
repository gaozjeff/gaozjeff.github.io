    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm currently purusing a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
      with a primary concentration in Structural Engineering and a secondary in Transportation Engineering. 
    </p>

    <p> 
      I'm a member of Illinois ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers) where I participate on our Concrete Canoe Team. I also enjoy playing 
      Ultimate Frisbee on Illinois Rise, UIUC's Club Sport Ultimate team, playing classical piano and taking landscape photos.

      <h3>Intro to Civil Engineering Feasibility Study</h3>
      <p>
        For our Intro Civil Engineering Class we were tasked with identifying an issue on campus and creating a feasibility study on whether our proposed solution could work. 
        Our group identified a problematic sidewalk on campus crossing Springfield Ave. between Bardeen quad and North quad due to heavy pedestrian and vehicle traffic. 
        We proposed constructing an underground pedestrian tunnel connecting Grainger Engineering Library and Digital Computer Lab to make crossing for pedestrians safer and make the road above more efficient instead of the current stop-and-go traffic.

      <h3>Revit Model of Literatures, Cultures and Languages Building</h3>
      <p>
        In our CAD Graphics and Design course our final project consisted of taking building plans for a given building and modeling the building in Revit. 
        For the first part of our project, we established the grids and levels of our project following the historical building plans to that we would have a baseline to go off for the rest of the model. 
        Following that we imported all of the necessary size beams and columns for each level and began modeling. We started out by laying out the foundational slabs and columns before working our way up level by level and finishing the structural beams.
        After our structures were finished we began constructing the walls for the exterior and interior and adding interior details such as windows and lights. 
        We did not add mechanical, electrical, or plumbing information as this was outside the scope of our project. As we finished up the interior we then began preparing furniture and other decorations for our renderings. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Once our Revit model was finished up we started by writing our report detailing our modeling process along with screenshots of our work. 
        We also completed a basic SketchUp model of the building and the exterior including two more surrounding  buildings and the main quad. 
        Finally, at the end of our report we included all the printed and annotated sheets for reference and comparison with the actual sheets
